## THE MAZE: Programming langage C

This program is an open source maze generator/solver.
A makefile is include. To start the program enter the following command:

make -s (option -s not to see the output of the makefile)
##
The program will start by asking you whether you like to generate
a maze or if you prefer to charge it from a file.
A maze file is present in the folder so you can charge by entering 2.

Otherwise if you enter 1, the program will generate a new maze,
store it in the file and resolve it with the Deep First Search algorithm.
